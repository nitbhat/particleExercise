# particleSimulation

This code simulates a set of particles moving randomly in a 2-dimensional space within a bounding box. The coordinates of the overall simulation box are between 0.0 and 100.0 along each dimension. The entire bounding box is divided into cells as shown in the image. There are `numCellsPerDim` or `k` cells along each dimension as shown in the image.
